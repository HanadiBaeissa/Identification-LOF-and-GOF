run FATHMM cancer
    FATHMM disease
    Polyphen-2
for cancer-associated mutation to get the features (31 features)

## Four features selected from FATHMM cancer including: HMM Weights D., HMM Weights O.,HMM Prob W. and HMM Prob M..
## One feature selected from FATHMM disease which is HMM Weights D..
## Nine features selected from PolyPhen-2 including: site, region, PHAT, PSIC Score1, dScore, Transv, CodPos, CpG and PfamHit. 

The last source of features was the protein  surface accessibility and secondary structure predictions (NetSurfP) server.
## Twelve features selected from (NetSurfP) each feature is provided twice, one for the wild type amino acid and one for 
## the mutant amino acid, include: Class assignment (B for buried or E for Exposed), relative surface accessibility (RSA), 
absolute surface accessibility, Probability for Alpha-Helix, Probability for Beta-strand and Probability for Coil.
